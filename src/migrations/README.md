# Chat Feature Migration

This folder contains everything you need to add the chat feature to your existing project, optimized to work with your existing database schema.

## What's Included

1. **Database Schema & RLS Policies** - SQL to create/update tables and security policies
2. **React Components** - All UI components for the chat interface
3. **Supabase Integration** - Service to connect components to your backend
4. **Types** - TypeScript definitions for the chat feature
5. **Utility Functions** - Helper functions for date formatting, etc.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Review `ChatFeatureMigration.md` for database setup instructions
2. Copy all components to your project following the structure in `file-list.md`
3. Follow the integration steps in `setup.md`

## Database Tables

Your existing database schema already includes the necessary tables:
- `conversations` - Stores chat conversations
- `conversation_participants` - Maps users to conversations
- `messages` - Stores individual chat messages
- `users` - Your existing users table

## Key Features

- Conversation list with unread indicators
- Real-time messaging via Supabase Realtime
- Typing indicators
- Message read status tracking
- Mobile-responsive design

## Migration Notes

1. This implementation focuses on private 1:1 messaging
2. Group chat would require additional database schema changes
3. The implementation uses Supabase Realtime for websocket communication
4. Make sure your auth system is properly connected
