We are working on implementing a "like" feature similar to Instagram, where users can like/unlike posts. However, we are encountering errors in our code. The main error is:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
(Not Found)
Error toggling like: {}
Additionally, there is an error in the useLikes.ts file at line 89:

lua
Copy
Edit
Error toggling like: {} [[Prototype]]: Object
The core functionality of the feature is based on toggling likes for posts in the "likes" table, and we are using Supabase to interact with the database.

Actions Taken So Far:

We have created the necessary tables in Supabase:

likes: To track which user has liked which post.

We are trying to toggle likes, meaning if the user has already liked a post, they can unlike it, and if they haven't, they can like it.

Issue:

The API request is returning an error: (Not Found) â€“ This suggests that the API call or the endpoint might not be correctly set up or may not be found.

The data object is empty ({}) in the error message, which indicates that either the necessary data (like user_id, post_id) is not being passed, or the API response is not returning as expected.

Suggested Code Fixes:

Ensure API Endpoint is Correct: Make sure the endpoint for toggling the like action is correct and functional in Supabase. Double-check the table name and query.

Pass the Correct Parameters: Ensure that user_id and post_id are passed correctly to the API when making requests.

Add Proper Error Handling and Logging: Improve error handling by logging detailed error messages, especially the responses from Supabase.

Update State After Toggle: After toggling the like, update the like count if necessary.

Here is an updated version of the toggleLike function with enhanced error handling:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const toggleLike = async (userId: string, postId: string) => {
  try {
    // Check if the user has already liked this post
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('likes')
      .select('*')
      .eq('user_id', userId)
      .eq('post_id', postId)
      .single();

    if (error) {
      console.error('Error checking like status:', error.message);
      return;
    }

    if (data) {
      // If already liked, unlike the post
      const { error: deleteError } = await supabase
        .from('likes')
        .delete()
        .eq('user_id', userId)
        .eq('post_id', postId);
        
      if (deleteError) {
        console.error('Error unliking post:', deleteError.message);
      }
    } else {
      // If not liked, insert a new like
      const { error: insertError } = await supabase
        .from('likes')
        .insert([{ user_id: userId, post_id: postId }]);
        
      if (insertError) {
        console.error('Error liking post:', insertError.message);
      }
    }

    // Optionally, update like count after toggling
    updateLikeCount(postId);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Unexpected error:', err);
  }
};
Key Improvements:

Error Logging: Logs errors when checking the like status, inserting or deleting a like.

Toggle Logic: Checks if the user has liked the post and toggles it accordingly.

Like Count Update: You may want to update the like count on the post after the toggle.

Please check if this resolves the issue and ensure that the database structure matches the queries used in the code. Also, verify that the Supabase project has been set up with the correct permissions for reading and modifying the likes table.
