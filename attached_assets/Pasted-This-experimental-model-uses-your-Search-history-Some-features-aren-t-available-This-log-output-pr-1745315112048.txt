This log output provides crucial information! The error is happening when your application is trying to call the Supabase RPC function update_user_profile. The error message clearly states:

message: 'null value in column "id" of relation "profiles" violates not-null constraint'
This means that your profiles table has a column named id which cannot be null (it's likely your primary key), and when your application tried to update the profile, it sent a null value for this id field.

Here's what you need to investigate in your application code:

How are you calling the update_user_profile RPC function after the Google login? Look at the code in your Settings.tsx file, specifically around line 133 and 148, where the error seems to be originating.
Are you correctly retrieving the user's ID after the Google login? When a user logs in with Google via Supabase, their unique ID is available from the auth.users table. This ID is also what should be used as the id in your profiles table (as seen in your create_profile function).
Are you including the user's ID in the data you are sending to the update_user_profile function? The error message indicates that the id field is missing or set to null in the data being sent for the update.
Here's a likely scenario and how to fix it:

After a successful Google login, your application might be immediately trying to update some user-specific information (like "I am interested in meeting with native speakers..."). However, at this point, the id of the newly created profile in your profiles table might not be immediately available or your application isn't correctly accessing it.

To fix this, you should ensure that when you call update_user_profile, you are correctly providing the id of the logged-in user. This id should match the id that was (or will be) created in the profiles table (which is the same as the user's auth ID).

Check your Settings.tsx code to see how you are constructing the data for the update_user_profile RPC call and make sure you are including the user's id. You can usually get the current user's ID from the Supabase client like this (in JavaScript):

JavaScript

const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
const userId = user?.id; // This should be the ID you use
Then, when you call your RPC function:

JavaScript

const { error } = await supabase
  .rpc('update_user_profile', {
    id: userId, // Make sure you are passing the user's ID here
    // other profile data to update...
  });
By ensuring that you are correctly passing the user's id in your update_user_profile RPC call, you should resolve the "null value in column "id"" error. The initial "permission denied" message might have been a consequence of this NOT NULL constraint violation causing the transaction to fail.
