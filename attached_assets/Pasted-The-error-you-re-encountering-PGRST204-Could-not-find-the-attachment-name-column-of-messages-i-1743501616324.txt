The error you're encountering, PGRST204: Could not find the 'attachment_name' column of 'messages' in the schema cache, indicates that Supabase (or the PostgREST service) can't find the attachment_name column in the messages table when you attempt to send a message. This can happen if the column is either missing from the schema or if it's not included in the database schema cache for your queries.

Steps to Resolve:
Verify Column Existence in the Database: Ensure that the attachment_name column actually exists in the messages table. You can do this by running a DESCRIBE or SELECT query to check the schema of the messages table:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'messages';
This will give you a list of all columns in the messages table, including attachment_name.

Check for Missing Column or Typos: If attachment_name is missing, you might need to add it to your table:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN attachment_name VARCHAR(255);  -- Adjust the type if needed
After adding the column, try sending the message again.

Clear Schema Cache: Sometimes, changes to the schema (like adding a new column) may not be immediately reflected in the cache used by the PostgREST service. You can refresh the schema cache by restarting the Supabase server or waiting a few minutes.

Check Column in Supabase: In the Supabase UI, navigate to your table (messages) and confirm that the attachment_name column is listed there. If not, add it manually.

Modify Code (if needed): After ensuring that the column exists, confirm that your code is correctly handling file uploads and sending the appropriate data in the attachment_name column. For example, make sure you're sending the correct file name or path when adding an attachment.

Example code snippet:

js
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('messages')
  .insert([
    {
      sender_id: senderId,
      conversation_id: conversationId,
      content: messageContent,
      attachment_name: fileName,  // Make sure you're passing the file name here
    },
  ]);

if (error) {
  console.error("Error sending message:", error.message);
} else {
  console.log("Message sent successfully:", data);
}
Check API Documentation: If you're using custom queries with PostgREST (via Supabase), ensure the query is correctly set up to handle the attachment_name column and that it corresponds to the right field in your database schema.
