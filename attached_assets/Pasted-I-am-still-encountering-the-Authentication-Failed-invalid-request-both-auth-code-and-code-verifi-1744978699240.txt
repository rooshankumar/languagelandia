I am still encountering the 'Authentication Failed - invalid request: both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty' error after successfully authenticating with Google and being redirected back to my application. This error occurs when Supabase attempts to exchange the authorization code for a session. It indicates an issue with the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) mechanism.

To help me resolve this, please focus on the following aspects of my code and the Google OAuth flow:

Code Verifier Generation:

Locate the part of my code where the code verifier is generated before the user is redirected to the Google sign-in page.
Verify that the code verifier is being generated correctly according to the PKCE specification. It should be a cryptographically random string.
Is the generated code verifier being stored somewhere reliably (e.g., in localStorage or sessionStorage) so that it can be retrieved later in the authentication flow?
Code Challenge Generation:

Find the code that generates the code challenge from the code verifier. This is what gets sent to Google during the initial authorization request.
Ensure the code challenge is being generated using the correct method (SHA256 hash of the code verifier base64 encoded without padding).
Authorization Request:

When the user clicks 'Sign in with Google', verify that the code challenge is being included in the authorization request sent to Google.
Callback Handling and Code Verifier Retrieval:

In the callback route where my application receives the authorization code from Google, locate the code that attempts to exchange this code for a Supabase session (likely using supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession).
Crucially, verify that the code verifier that was generated earlier is being correctly retrieved from storage and included in this exchange request to Supabase. This is where the error is likely occurring â€“ either the code verifier is not being retrieved or it's no longer available.
Asynchronous Operations and Timing:

Are there any asynchronous operations involved in the generation, storage, or retrieval of the code verifier that might be causing timing issues? For example, is the callback being processed before the code verifier has been stored or retrieved?
Storage Mechanisms:

If I am using localStorage or sessionStorage to store the code verifier, are there any potential issues with how I am setting and getting the value? For example, are there any race conditions or scenarios where the stored value might be overwritten or cleared prematurely?
Please help me trace the flow of the code verifier from its generation to its use in the session exchange with Supabase. Let's add logging at each of these steps to see where the code verifier might be going missing or if it's empty when the exchange request is made. Provide code snippets or guidance on how to implement this detailed tracing and logging within my React code."
