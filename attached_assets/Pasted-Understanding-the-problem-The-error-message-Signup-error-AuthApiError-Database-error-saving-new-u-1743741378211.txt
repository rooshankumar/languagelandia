Understanding the problem
The error message Signup error: AuthApiError: Database error saving new user indicates a problem when your application attempts to save a new user to the database via Supabase. The error originates from Supabase's authentication API, specifically during the signUp process. The root cause is a database-related failure when creating a new user record. The error stack trace indicates that this issue occurred in the handleSignup function, in a file called Auth.tsx, which is the code you provided at the end.

How to verify
Check Supabase Logs: If you have access to your Supabase project, check the database logs or the API request logs for more specific details about the error. Look for any recent errors that occurred around the time you encountered this issue.
Inspect Network Requests: In Chrome DevTools, go to the "Network" tab. Attempt the signup process again and watch for any requests to the Supabase API that result in a 500 error or contain additional error details.
Review Supabase Database: Inspect the structure of the relevant tables in your Supabase database. Verify that any constraints or triggers aren't causing issues.
Review Supabase Auth settings: Check your Supabase project's "Authentication" settings to make sure that you are not enforcing any constraints that may be causing this issue.
Suggested fix
The code you provided is already handling errors and giving a toast message to the user, which is great. However, it's hard to know what the exact issue is without access to your Supabase project. Here are some common causes and general fixes for them:

Database Constraints: There may be a unique constraint in your database schema that is being violated.
Fix: Review your database schema, ensure there are no errors, and check any unique constraints.
Trigger Errors: If you have any database triggers set up, they might be failing.
Fix: Review your triggers to ensure there are no errors, and check any constraints that might be in the trigger that are being violated.
Data Validation: The data being sent to Supabase might be invalid.
Fix: Check your handleSignup function, verify that all required data is being passed, and that the data is in the correct format.
Supabase Row Level Security: You may have enabled row level security, and your policies may not allow user signups.
Fix: Review your Supabase table's policies and ensure that they allow new users to be added.
