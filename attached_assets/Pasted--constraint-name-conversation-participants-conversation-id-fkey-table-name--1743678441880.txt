ChatGPT said:
From your SQL query results, the conversation_participants table does have a foreign key on user_id, but it references auth.users instead of public.users.

Why is This Causing the Issue?
The error "Could not find a relationship between 'conversation_participants' and 'users' in the schema cache" happens because:

Supabase/PostgREST is likely looking for public.users, but your user_id references auth.users.

If you query conversation_participants with .select("users(id, email)"), Supabase expects users in the public schema, not in auth.

Your database schema might need adjustments to work correctly with Supabase's automatic API relationships.

Possible Fixes
Option 1: Update Your Query to Explicitly Use auth.users
Try changing your Supabase query to reference auth.users explicitly:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("conversation_participants")
  .select("conversation_id, auth.users(id, email)")
  .eq("user_id", userId);
If auth.users is not accessible in .select(), Supabase might not support cross-schema relationships in API queries. In that case, consider Option 2.

Option 2: Create a View to Bridge auth.users and public.users
Since Supabase’s API expects users in public, create a view in public that references auth.users:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW public.users AS 
SELECT id, email, raw_user_meta_data
FROM auth.users;
Then, your query will work as expected:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("conversation_participants")
  .select("conversation_id, users(id, email)")
  .eq("user_id", userId);
Option 3: Change the Foreign Key to public.users
If you prefer to use public.users instead of auth.users, you need to:

Create a users table in public and sync it with auth.users.

Update the foreign key in conversation_participants.

This approach is not recommended unless you're ready to manage user syncing manually.

Final Recommendation
Try Option 1 first (updating the query).

If that doesn’t work, Option 2 (creating a view) is the safest fix.

Changing the foreign key (Option 3) is a more complex solution that requires manual user syncing.
