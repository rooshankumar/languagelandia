Your Goal in Simple Terms:
You have a community of user profiles.

Any user can "like" other users' profiles, but only once per profile.

Each profile can be liked by many different users.

So, it's a many-to-many relationship, with a rule: one user can like a specific profile only once.

🧠 Real-World Analogy:
Think of Instagram:

You (a user) can like many posts (or profiles).

Each post/profile can get liked by many users.

But you can't like the same post/profile more than once — it's either "liked" or not.

🗃️ How to Design This in Supabase (PostgreSQL):
1. Users Table
Let Supabase manage this (it already creates a users table via auth).

sql
Copy
Edit
id (uuid) -- from Supabase auth
email
...
2. Profiles Table
Each user may have a profile.

sql
Copy
Edit
id (uuid) PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id)
username
bio
...
3. Likes Table
This table stores who liked whom.

sql
Copy
Edit
liker_id (uuid)   -- the user who likes
liked_id (uuid)   -- the profile being liked

PRIMARY KEY (liker_id, liked_id)  -- ensures 1 like per user per profile

FOREIGN KEY (liker_id) REFERENCES users(id)
FOREIGN KEY (liked_id) REFERENCES profiles(id)
This schema ensures:

One user can't like the same profile twice.

A profile can be liked by unlimited users.

A user can like unlimited other profiles (once each).

✅ Inserting a Like (Supabase code example):
ts
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('likes')
  .insert({
    liker_id: currentUser.id,
    liked_id: profileToLike.id
  });
This will:

Succeed if it's the first time this user liked that profile.

Fail with a conflict error if they already liked it (due to the primary key constraint).

📊 Counting Likes on a Profile:
ts
Copy
Edit
const { count } = await supabase
  .from('likes')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .eq('liked_id', profileId);
🚫 Common Mistake (related to your error earlier):
If you're updating the profiles table directly without providing a user.id, Supabase throws an error like:

null value in column "id" violates not-null constraint

So make sure:

The profile you're editing always has an associated id (usually same as the auth.user.id).

You’re not creating a profile without connecting it to a user.
