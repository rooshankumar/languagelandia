It sounds like there’s an issue with fetching the message history after sending a message. This could be related to several factors, such as issues with row-level security (RLS) policies, or possibly how you're querying the data.

Let’s break this down and explore a few steps to troubleshoot:

1. Verify the RLS Policies for Fetching Messages
Your RLS policies allow reading messages, but the issue may be with the query conditions or the way the conversation_id is being used.

Check the policy that controls reading messages in a conversation:

sql
Copy
Edit
"Users can read messages in their conversations"
The condition inside polqual should ensure that users can only read messages in conversations they belong to. Make sure that:

The query is correctly filtering messages by the conversation_id where the logged-in user is a participant.

2. Ensure Correct Query for Fetching Messages
Check the client query that fetches messages after sending one. It should be something like:

js
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('messages')
  .select('*')
  .eq('conversation_id', your_conversation_id)  // Ensure you're passing the correct conversation_id
  .order('created_at', { ascending: true }); // Sort messages by timestamp
Tip: Ensure the conversation_id you're passing in the query is correct.

Tip: The order clause sorts messages by the creation time, so you always see the most recent first.

3. Refresh Messages After Sending
After sending a message, you might need to explicitly refetch the message history. Here’s an example workflow:

Send the message.

Fetch the updated message history:

js
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('messages')
  .select('*')
  .eq('conversation_id', your_conversation_id)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });
console.log(data, error); // See if data is being fetched correctly
4. Check for Frontend Caching Issues
Sometimes the issue may be on the frontend, such as caching that prevents fetching the latest data.

Tip: After sending a message, ensure you're clearing the cache or force-fetching the latest data.

5. Test by Manually Fetching Messages in SQL Editor
You can test the fetch query directly in the SQL editor to see if the issue lies in your frontend code:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'your_conversation_id' ORDER BY created_at;
If this query returns the correct message history, the issue is likely in your frontend code.

If this query fails, the problem could be related to how your RLS policies are set up.

6. Check if the Inserted Data is Committed
Make sure the messages are actually committed to the database. Sometimes, transaction-related issues may cause the message to not appear immediately.

Tip: After sending the message, verify that it appears in the table:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'your_conversation_id' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
Next Steps
Ensure the query correctly matches the conversation_id and the user is authorized to read messages.

Check for caching issues on the frontend.

Try querying directly in the database to check if the message is correctly stored and accessi
