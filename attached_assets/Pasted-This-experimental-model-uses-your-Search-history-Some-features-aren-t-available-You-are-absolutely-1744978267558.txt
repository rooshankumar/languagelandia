You are absolutely right! Thank you for the correction. My apologies for the mistake. Your project is hosted on Vercel with the production domain https://roshlingua.vercel.app/.

Let's revise the prompt for Replit AI to reflect this accurate information. Please use the following prompt:

Revised Prompt for Replit AI:

"I am experiencing issues with Google OAuth authentication in my React project. I am using Supabase for authentication, and my project is hosted on Vercel with the production domain https://roshlingua.vercel.app/. Email/password authentication is working correctly, but Google OAuth is not.

I have already confirmed the following:

The redirection URLs are correctly configured in both the Google Cloud Console for my OAuth 2.0 client ID and in the Supabase Auth settings under 'URL Configuration' (Redirect URLs).
Here are the steps to reproduce the issue (please guide me through them in the code):

Click the 'Sign in with Google' button in my application.
I am redirected to the Google sign-in page.
After selecting my Google account and granting permissions, I am redirected back to my application (or at least I expect to be). Please help me trace where the redirection is going and if any errors are occurring at this stage.
To help diagnose the problem, please assist me in checking the following aspects of my code and configuration:

Supabase Client Initialization:

Locate where I initialize the Supabase client in my React code (likely in main.tsx or a similar entry point).
Verify that the supabaseUrl and supabaseKey are being correctly passed, ideally using environment variables for security.
Could there be any Vercel-specific considerations for these environment variables? For instance, how should I ensure they are correctly accessed in my deployed environment?
Google Sign-in Function:

Find the function in my React code that handles the Google sign-in action. It likely uses supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' }).
Check if I am passing any specific options to this function, particularly the redirectTo URL. Is it correctly pointing to my production domain https://roshlingua.vercel.app/ or the specific callback route within it?
Redirection URL Handling:

Identify the route or component in my React application that is supposed to handle the callback after successful Google authentication. This is the URL I configured in Google Cloud and Supabase (e.g., https://roshlingua.vercel.app/auth/callback or a similar route).
Help me add logging within this callback route to see if it's being hit and if any data (like session information or error messages) is being received from Supabase.
Are there any specific steps needed to process the authentication callback in a React application with react-router-dom deployed on Vercel when using Supabase?
Supabase Auth Settings:

Guide me on how to double-check the Google Auth Provider settings in my Supabase project dashboard.
Ensure that the Client ID from my Google Cloud Console is correctly entered in the Supabase settings. Is there anything else I should verify in the Supabase settings for Google OAuth?
Google Cloud Console Configuration:

Remind me to verify the Authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URIs in my Google Cloud Console's OAuth 2.0 client ID settings.
Specifically, should my Vercel production domain https://roshlingua.vercel.app/ and potentially any staging or preview URLs be included in both? What about the callback route (e.g., https://roshlingua.vercel.app/auth/callback) - where should this be added?
Error Messages:

Check the browser's developer console (Network tab and Console tab) for any error messages related to the Google sign-in or redirection process. Help me understand any errors I might be seeing.
Check the Supabase logs in the dashboard for any authentication-related errors.
Vercel Environment:

Are there any known issues or specific configurations required when using Google OAuth with Supabase in a Vercel environment? For example, any specific environment variable handling or serverless function considerations?
Please provide me with code snippets or guidance on how to implement these checks and add logging to help me pinpoint the issue. Let's work together step-by-step to get Google OAuth working correctly in my application on Vercel."
