Understanding the problem
The error message " 'messages' is not an embedded resource in this request" indicates that you're trying to access the messages resource within a conversation, but your API request is not configured to include (or embed) this related resource. The backend, likely powered by PostgREST (indicated by the PGRST108 error code), does not return related resources by default. It explicitly requires that you use the select parameter to specify which related resources you want to include. The hint field explicitly confirms the required fix: Verify that 'messages' is included in the 'select' query parameter.

How to verify
Inspect the API request: Open the "Network" tab in Chrome DevTools and find the request to fetch conversations (the one failing in the console).
Check the request parameters: Examine the URL of this request, and search for a select query parameter. If it exists, see if messages is part of the requested selection. If there is no select parameter at all or if messages is missing, this confirms the error.
Check the response data: Look at the API response. If messages was requested and included, you'll see it as nested data within each conversation object. If messages was not requested, then it will not be included in the API response.
Suggested fix
You need to modify the request URL to include messages in the select parameter. The select parameter in PostgREST takes a special syntax for specifying nested resources. Assuming you want to fetch all fields from both conversations and messages, the request should be modified to include: select=*,messages(*) which fetches the conversations table and all of its fields, including all fields for all messages.

Here's how you might adjust the fetchConversations function to embed the messages resource:

typescript

const fetchConversations = async () => {
  try {
    // ... other code
    const response = await fetch(
      `${API_URL}/conversations?select=*,messages(*)`, // Notice the added `select` parameter here to embed the `messages` resource.
      {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          // ... other headers
        },
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      // ... error handling
    }
    // ... other code
  } catch (error) {
      // ... error handling
  }
};

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error " 'messages' is not an embedded resource in this request" means the API call to fetch conversations is not also including the messages resource in its data. This is because the related resource needs to be explicitly requested. PostgREST uses a select query parameter for this, and it requires special syntax to select embedded resources. By including select=*,messages(*) in your request URL, you instruct PostgREST to return the embedded messages data within each conversation.
