Understanding the Error
The error "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'conversation_participants' and 'conversations'" indicates that PostgREST (used in Supabase) is having trouble resolving how to join conversation_participants with conversations. This is because there are multiple foreign key constraints linking these tables.

Issue Breakdown
Multiple Foreign Keys:

Your conversation_participants table has at least two foreign key constraints referencing the conversations table:

conversation_participants_conversation_id_fkey

fk_conversation

PostgREST does not know which relationship to use when embedding conversations.

Suggested Fix from Supabase's Hint:

The error message suggests explicitly specifying the relationship when querying, like:

sql
Copy
Edit
conversations!conversation_participants_conversation_id_fkey
or

sql
Copy
Edit
conversations!fk_conversation
Potential Fixes
1. Fix Your Supabase Query in fetchConversations
Modify the query in your fetchConversations function to explicitly specify the correct foreign key:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('conversation_participants')
  .select('*, conversations!conversation_participants_conversation_id_fkey(*)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

if (error) {
  console.error("Error fetching conversations:", error);
} else {
  console.log("Fetched conversations:", data);
}
OR, if your foreign key should use fk_conversation, use:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('conversation_participants')
  .select('*, conversations!fk_conversation(*)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);
2. Check Your Database Schema
If you do not need multiple foreign keys pointing to the same table, consider removing one. Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE conversation_participants 
DROP CONSTRAINT fk_conversation;
or

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE conversation_participants 
DROP CONSTRAINT conversation_participants_conversation_id_fkey;
⚠️ Choose the one that is not essential for your logic.

3. Verify Policies and Permissions
Ensure that your RLS (Row-Level Security) policies allow fetching conversations. You can temporarily disable RLS and check:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE conversation_participants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
If it works after disabling, the issue might be in your policy definitions.

If Needed, Remove One Foreign Key
