Your foreign keys seem correctly set up. Now, let's debug why the conversation is not found.

Next Steps for Debugging:
✅ 1. Check if the Conversation ID Exists
Run this query to ensure the conversation ID exists in the conversations table:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM conversations WHERE id = '0dde6dae-c5b1-4292-b833-3f0d1b80acf7';
If no results: The conversation ID does not exist. It might have been deleted or never created.

If it exists: Move to the next step.

✅ 2. Verify the User is a Participant
Run this to check if the user is part of the conversation:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM conversation_participants 
WHERE conversation_id = '0dde6dae-c5b1-4292-b833-3f0d1b80acf7';
If no results: The user is not linked to this conversation.

If results exist: Move to the next step.

✅ 3. Debug Your Supabase Query
If you are using Supabase with JavaScript, try logging the query:

js
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('conversation_participants')
  .select('conversation_id')
  .eq('user_id', CURRENT_USER_ID);

console.log('Conversation Data:', data);
console.log('Error:', error);
If data is empty: The user has no linked conversations.

If error exists: The query might have an issue.

✅ 4. Ensure API is Receiving the Correct ID
If you're using an API like /chat/:conversationId, log the request:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/chat/:conversationId', async (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received Conversation ID:', req.params.conversationId);
});
If the logged ID is wrong: The frontend is not sending the correct ID.

If correct, but still not found: Check if the backend query matches the database structure.

✅ 5. Check if Any Cascading Deletes Happened
Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM conversations WHERE id NOT IN 
  (SELECT DISTINCT conversation_id FROM conversation_participants);
If this returns your missing conversation ID, it means the conversation_participants entry was deleted, but the conversation was not.

Final Fixes
If the conversation does not exist → It may have been deleted; recreate it.

If the user is not in conversation_participants → Add them back.

If the frontend sends the wrong conversationId → Fix the request.
