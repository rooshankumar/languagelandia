User Management
Supabase makes it easy to manage your users.

Supabase assigns each user a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a profiles table references the user using a user_id field.

Supabase already has built in the routes to sign up, login, and log out for managing users in your apps and websites.

Sign up
Allow your users to sign up and create a new account.

After they have signed up, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

User signup
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'someone@email.com',
  password: 'SQwRyWLhflVpgJiGOOrm'
})
Log in with Email/Password
If an account is created, users can login to your app.

After they have logged in, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

User login
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'someone@email.com',
  password: 'SQwRyWLhflVpgJiGOOrm'
})
Log in with Magic Link via Email
Send a user a passwordless link which they can use to redeem an access_token.

After they have clicked the link, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

User login
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
  email: 'someone@email.com'
})
Sign Up with Phone/Password
A phone number can be used instead of an email as a primary account confirmation mechanism.

The user will receive a mobile OTP via sms with which they can verify that they control the phone number.

You must enter your own twilio credentials on the auth settings page to enable sms confirmations.

Phone Signup
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  phone: '+13334445555',
  password: 'some-password'
})
Login via SMS OTP
SMS OTPs work like magic links, except you have to provide an interface for the user to verify the 6 digit number they receive.

You must enter your own twilio credentials on the auth settings page to enable SMS-based Logins.

Phone Login
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
  phone: '+13334445555'
})
Verify an SMS OTP
Once the user has received the OTP, have them enter it in a form and send it for verification

You must enter your own twilio credentials on the auth settings page to enable SMS-based OTP verification.

Verify Pin
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
  phone: '+13334445555',
  token: '123456',
  type: 'sms'
})
